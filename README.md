#Google Books Search App using React

##Description This app was created for me to learn about using react and interacting with an API. It uses the googlebooks api to collect search results based on a query input by the user. It will also use a custom caching function to display the last 10 user queries and save the results to avoid excessive requests from the API

##Status This project is currently under development. I am working on learning more about react hooks and the materials UI. The current code needs to be refactored so that the methods work more seamlessly to interact with and allow me to implement the cacheing function.
